    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
    <h3 class="mypoet">by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <p class="mypoem">
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
        who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
        Stand in the desert . . . . Near them, on thr sand<br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        tell that Its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
        My name is Ozymandias <br>
        Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair<br>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br>
    </p>
